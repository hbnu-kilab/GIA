# Evaluation Protocol


Design a comprehensive evaluation protocol to demonstrate the value and uniqueness of our NetworkConfigQA dataset.

## Dataset Context:
- **NetworkConfigQA**: 759 samples, 85.0% topology-focused
- **Real network topology data** from production environments
- **Hybrid generation** (rule-based + LLM)
- **Multi-complexity** questions (5 levels)

## Evaluation Goals:
1. **Validate dataset quality** and consistency
2. **Demonstrate topology-specific value** vs general networking knowledge
3. **Show practical utility** for network configuration understanding
4. **Compare with existing benchmarks** (where applicable)

## Required Experimental Design:

### Experiment 1: Baseline Model Performance
Design experiments using:
- **General LLMs**: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini (zero-shot, few-shot)
- **Code-Understanding Models**: CodeBERT, CodeT5, UniXcoder
- **Domain-Adapted Models**: Any network-specific models found in literature

**Metrics to Report**:
- Exact Match accuracy
- F1 score (token-level)
- BLEU score (for longer answers)
- Category-wise performance
- Complexity-wise performance

### Experiment 2: Topology-Specific vs General Knowledge
Design evaluation to show:
- Performance gap between topology-specific and general networking questions
- Whether models struggle more with our topology-focused questions
- Comparison with general networking QA benchmarks (if available)

### Experiment 3: Fine-tuning Effectiveness
Design experiments showing:
- Performance improvement when fine-tuning on our dataset
- Transfer learning to other network configuration tasks
- Few-shot learning effectiveness

### Experiment 4: Human Evaluation
Design human evaluation for:
- Question quality and difficulty assessment
- Answer correctness validation
- Practical utility rating from network professionals

## Experimental Protocol Template:

### Setup:
- **Models**: [List of models to evaluate]
- **Splits**: Use our train/val/test splits
- **Metrics**: [Primary and secondary metrics]
- **Baselines**: [Comparison baselines]

### Statistical Analysis:
- Significance testing protocol
- Confidence intervals
- Effect size measurements

### Error Analysis:
- Categorize failure modes
- Analyze performance by question type
- Identify model limitations

## Output Requirements:
1. **Detailed experimental protocol** (step-by-step)
2. **Expected results table template** (with placeholders)
3. **Statistical analysis plan**
4. **Timeline and resource requirements**

Please provide a comprehensive evaluation plan that would be convincing to paper reviewers.
