# Paper Positioning


Based on your benchmark survey, help me write the positioning and contribution sections for our NetworkConfigQA paper.

## Background Information:
Our dataset, NetworkConfigQA, has these characteristics:
- **759** question-answer pairs
- Generated from **real production network configurations** (XML files)
- **85.0%** of questions focus on topology-specific understanding (not general networking knowledge)
- **Hybrid generation**: Rule-based + LLM-enhanced question generation
- **5 complexity levels**: basic, analytical, synthetic, diagnostic, scenario
- **Multi-persona**: Questions from different professional perspectives (network engineer, security auditor, etc.)

## Tasks:

### 1. Related Work Section (2-3 paragraphs)
Write a related work section that:
- Summarizes existing datasets/benchmarks you found
- Categorizes them into logical groups
- Identifies limitations of existing approaches
- Sets up the motivation for our work

### 2. Contributions Section (Bullet points)
Generate 4-5 key contributions that highlight:
- What's novel about our approach
- What research gaps we're filling
- What methodological advances we're making
- What practical applications this enables

### 3. Dataset Positioning Statement (1 paragraph)
Write a clear positioning statement explaining:
- How our dataset differs from existing work
- Why topology-specific focus is important
- Why real production data matters
- How our hybrid generation approach is superior

### 4. Evaluation Strategy (1-2 paragraphs)
Suggest how to evaluate our dataset against existing benchmarks:
- What experiments to run
- What metrics to compare
- How to demonstrate superiority
- What baseline models to use

### Writing Style:
- Academic but accessible
- Clear motivation and positioning
- Avoid overclaiming
- Use precise technical language
- Include specific numbers/percentages where helpful

### Output Format:
Please provide each section with clear headers and ready-to-use academic text.
