# Visualization Improvement


Review and improve the visualizations for our NetworkConfigQA paper to make them more impactful and publication-ready.

## Current Visualizations:
We have generated these figures and tables:
1. **Figure 1**: Dataset overview (4 subplots: train/val/test split, generation method, answer types, complexity distribution)
2. **Figure 2**: Category distribution (category counts + topology-specific vs general)
3. **Figure 3**: Complexity analysis (stacked bar + question length by complexity)
4. **Figure 4**: Question-answer length distributions
5. **Figure 5**: Topology focus analysis (keyword frequency + category scores)
6. **Table 1**: Basic dataset statistics
7. **Table 2**: Benchmark comparison (currently with dummy data)
8. **Table 3**: Category-wise detailed analysis

## Improvement Tasks:

### 1. Figure Enhancement Suggestions
For each figure, suggest improvements for:
- **Clarity**: How to make the message clearer
- **Visual Appeal**: Better colors, layouts, fonts
- **Academic Standards**: What makes figures publication-ready
- **Information Density**: What to add/remove for maximum impact

### 2. New Figure Ideas
Suggest 2-3 additional figures that would strengthen the paper:
- What aspects of our dataset aren't well visualized yet?
- What comparisons with other datasets would be impactful?
- What would help readers understand our contribution better?

### 3. Table Improvements
For each table, suggest:
- Better organization and grouping
- Additional metrics that would be valuable
- More effective presentation format
- What information is missing

### 4. Caption Writing
Write publication-ready captions for each figure/table that:
- Clearly explain what's shown
- Highlight key takeaways
- Guide reader attention to important details
- Follow academic writing conventions

### 5. Statistical Significance
Suggest where to add:
- Error bars or confidence intervals
- Statistical significance tests
- Correlation analyses
- Distribution comparisons

## Output Format:
For each visualization, provide:
1. **Current Assessment**: What works well, what doesn't
2. **Specific Improvements**: Concrete suggestions with rationale
3. **Publication-Ready Caption**: Complete caption text
4. **Implementation Notes**: How to make the changes

## Style Guidelines:
- **Academic conferences**: ACL, EMNLP style figures
- **Color blind friendly**: Accessible color schemes
- **High resolution**: Vector graphics where possible
- **Consistent styling**: Unified look across all figures

Please provide detailed, actionable feedback for publication-quality visualizations.
