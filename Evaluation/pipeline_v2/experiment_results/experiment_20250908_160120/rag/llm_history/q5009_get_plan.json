Create a step-by-step execution plan\n    to find the answer to the user's question from XML network configuration files.\n\n    User Question: \"sample10 장비와 eBGP로 연결된 피어들의 IP 주소 목록을 알려주세요.\"\n\n    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1) Decompose the problem into atomic, verifiable steps.\n    2) Each step MUST start with an action verb (Search, Find, Extract, List, Compare, Calculate).\n    3) The final step MUST be: \"Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\"\n    4) Output ONLY the numbered steps. No extra text.\n\n    --- EXAMPLE ---\n    1. Search for the BGP configuration of the device named 'sample7'.\n    2. Extract all BGP neighbor IP addresses and their corresponding remote-as numbers.\n    3. For each neighbor IP, search all documents to identify which device that IP belongs to.\n    4. Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\n    --- END EXAMPLE ---\n    ",
