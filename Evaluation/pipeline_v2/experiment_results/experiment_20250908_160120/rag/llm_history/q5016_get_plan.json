  "prompt": "system: You are an expert network engineering assistant with deep knowledge of network configurations, troubleshooting, and security best practices.\nuser: \n    You are a world-class network engineer acting as a meticulous planner. Create a step-by-step execution plan\n    to find the answer to the user's question from XML network configuration files.\n\n    User Question: \"AS 65000의 iBGP Full-Mesh에서 누락된 링크는 총 몇 개입니까?\"\n\n    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1) Decompose the problem into atomic, verifiable steps.\n    2) Each step MUST start with an action verb (Search, Find, Extract, List, Compare, Calculate).\n    3) The final step MUST be: \"Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\"\n    4) Output ONLY the numbered steps. No extra text.\n\n    --- EXAMPLE ---\n    1. Search for the BGP configuration of the device named 'sample7'.\n    2. Extract all BGP neighbor IP addresses and their corresponding remote-as numbers.\n    3. For each neighbor IP, search all documents to identify which device that IP belongs to.\n    4. Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\n    --- END EXAMPLE ---\n    ",
  "response": "1. Search for all XML network configuration files that contain BGP configurations for AS 65000.  \n2. Extract all iBGP neighbor IP addresses from the BGP configurations of AS 65000.  \n3. List all unique devices that are part of AS 65000 based on the extracted iBGP neighbor IP addresses.  \n4. Calculate the total number of devices in AS 65000.  \n5. Compare the total number of devices to the expected number of iBGP links in a full-mesh topology (N*(N-1)/2, where N is the number of devices).  \n6. Calculate the number of missing links by subtracting the actual number of iBGP links from the expected number of links.  \n7. Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.",
