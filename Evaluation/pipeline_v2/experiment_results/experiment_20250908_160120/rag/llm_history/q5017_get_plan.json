  "prompt": "system: You are an expert network engineering assistant with deep knowledge of network configurations, troubleshooting, and security best practices.\nuser: \n    You are a world-class network engineer acting as a meticulous planner. Create a step-by-step execution plan\n    to find the answer to the user's question from XML network configuration files.\n\n    User Question: \"AS 65001의 iBGP Full-Mesh에서 누락된 링크는 총 몇 개입니까?\"\n\n    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1) Decompose the problem into atomic, verifiable steps.\n    2) Each step MUST start with an action verb (Search, Find, Extract, List, Compare, Calculate).\n    3) The final step MUST be: \"Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\"\n    4) Output ONLY the numbered steps. No extra text.\n\n    --- EXAMPLE ---\n    1. Search for the BGP configuration of the device named 'sample7'.\n    2. Extract all BGP neighbor IP addresses and their corresponding remote-as numbers.\n    3. For each neighbor IP, search all documents to identify which device that IP belongs to.\n    4. Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\n    --- END EXAMPLE ---\n    ",
  "response": "1. Search for the XML network configuration files that contain BGP settings for AS 65001.  \n2. Extract all iBGP neighbor IP addresses from the BGP configuration sections of the XML files.  \n3. List all unique iBGP neighbor IP addresses identified in the previous step.  \n4. Calculate the total number of iBGP peers based on the unique neighbor IP addresses.  \n5. Compare the total number of iBGP peers with the expected number of peers in a full-mesh topology for AS 65001.  \n6. Calculate the number of missing links by determining the difference between the expected number of links and the actual number of iBGP peers.  \n7. Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.",
