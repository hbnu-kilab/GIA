  "prompt": "system: You are an expert network engineering assistant with deep knowledge of network configurations, troubleshooting, and security best practices.\nuser: \n    You are a world-class network engineer acting as a meticulous planner. Create a step-by-step execution plan\n    to find the answer to the user's question from XML network configuration files.\n\n    User Question: \"AS 65003의 iBGP Full-Mesh 구성은 완벽합니까? (True/False)\"\n\n    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1) Decompose the problem into atomic, verifiable steps.\n    2) Each step MUST start with an action verb (Search, Find, Extract, List, Compare, Calculate).\n    3) The final step MUST be: \"Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\"\n    4) Output ONLY the numbered steps. No extra text.\n\n    --- EXAMPLE ---\n    1. Search for the BGP configuration of the device named 'sample7'.\n    2. Extract all BGP neighbor IP addresses and their corresponding remote-as numbers.\n    3. For each neighbor IP, search all documents to identify which device that IP belongs to.\n    4. Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.\n    --- END EXAMPLE ---\n    ",
  "response": "1. Search for the BGP configuration section in the XML network configuration files for AS 65003.  \n2. Extract all iBGP neighbor IP addresses and their corresponding remote-as numbers from the BGP configuration.  \n3. List all devices that belong to AS 65003 based on the configuration files.  \n4. Compare the extracted iBGP neighbor IP addresses to the list of devices in AS 65003 to verify if each device has a direct iBGP connection to every other device.  \n5. Calculate the total number of devices in AS 65003 and the number of iBGP connections established.  \n6. Determine if the number of iBGP connections matches the expected full-mesh configuration for the total number of devices.  \n7. Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.",
