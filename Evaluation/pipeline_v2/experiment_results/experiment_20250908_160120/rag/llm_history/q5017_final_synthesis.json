  "prompt": "system: You are an expert network engineering assistant with deep knowledge of network configurations, troubleshooting, and security best practices.\nuser: \n        You are a final rapporteur. Synthesize all step-by-step findings into the final answer.\n\n        Original User Question: \"AS 65001의 iBGP Full-Mesh에서 누락된 링크는 총 몇 개입니까?\"\n\n        Accumulated Findings:\nResult[1] Search for the XML network configuration files that contain BGP settings for AS:\nThe XML network configuration files that contain BGP settings for AS 65001 are as follows:\n\n1. Configuration for device **CE1**:\n   - Contains BGP settings with AS number **65001**.\n\n2. Configuration for device **CE2**:\n   - Contains BGP settings with AS number **65003** (not relevant for AS 65001).\n\n3. Configuration for device **sample7**:\n   - Contains BGP settings with AS number **65000** (not relevant for AS 65001).\n\n4. Configuration for device **sample8**:\n   - Contains BGP settings with AS number **65000** (not relevant for AS 65001).\n\n5. Configuration for device **sample9**:\n   - Contains BGP settings with AS number **65000** (not relevant for AS 65001).\n\n6. Configuration for device **sample10**:\n   - Contains BGP settings with AS number **65000** (not relevant for AS 65001).\n\nThus, the only relevant configuration file for AS 65001 is from **CE1**.\n\nResult[2] Extract all iBGP neighbor IP addresses from the BGP configuration sections of the XML files.:\nThe iBGP neighbor IP address extracted from the BGP configuration section of the XML file for AS 65001 (from device CE1) is:\n\n- 192.168.1.10\n\nThus, the unique iBGP neighbor IP addresses identified are:\n- 192.168.1.10\n\nResult[3] List all unique iBGP neighbor IP addresses identified in the previous step.:\nThe unique iBGP neighbor IP addresses identified are:\n- 192.168.1.10\n\nResult[4] Calculate the total number of iBGP peers based on the unique neighbor IP addresses.:\nThe total number of iBGP peers based on the unique neighbor IP addresses identified is **1**.\n\nResult[5] Compare the total number of iBGP peers with the expected number of peers in a full-mesh topology for AS:\nThe expected number of peers in a full-mesh topology for AS 65001 can be calculated using the formula \\( n(n-1)/2 \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of iBGP peers. Since we have only one iBGP peer (192.168.1.10), the expected number of peers is:\n\n- \\( n = 1 \\)\n- Expected number of links = \\( 1(1-1)/2 = 0 \\)\n\nThe actual number of iBGP peers is **1**.\n\nThus, the comparison shows:\n- Expected number of peers in a full-mesh topology: **0**\n- Actual number of iBGP peers: **1**\n\nSince the expected number of peers is 0, there are no missing links in this case.\n\n**Result**: 0 missing links.\n\nResult[6] Calculate the number of missing links by determining the difference between the expected number of links and the actual number of iBGP peers.:\nINSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT_FOR_THIS_STEP\n\nResult[7] Synthesize all findings into a final answer in the required format.:\nINSUFFICIENT_CONTEXT_FOR_THIS_STEP\n\n        CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:\n        - Output MUST contain BOTH [GROUND_TRUTH] and [EXPLANATION].\n        - [GROUND_TRUTH]: ONLY the exact value(s). No labels/extra words. Multiple items → comma+space.\n        - Sort device names alphabetically where relevant. Counts are numbers only.\n        - [EXPLANATION]: Detailed Korean technical explanation based strictly on the findings.\n        ",
  "response": "[GROUND_TRUTH] 0\n\n[EXPLANATION] AS 65001의 iBGP Full-Mesh에서 누락된 링크는 총 0개입니다. iBGP 피어링을 위해 필요한 링크 수는 \\( n(n-1)/2 \\) 공식을 사용하여 계산할 수 있습니다. 여기서 \\( n \\)은 iBGP 피어의 수입니다. 현재 AS 65001에서 확인된 iBGP 피어는 1개(192.168.1.10)입니다. 따라서 기대되는 링크 수는 \\( 1(1-1)/2 = 0 \\)입니다. 실제 iBGP 피어 수는 1개로, 기대되는 링크 수와 비교했을 때 누락된 링크는 없습니다.",
