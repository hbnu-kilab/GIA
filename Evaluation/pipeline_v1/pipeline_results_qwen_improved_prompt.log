Question: AS 65000 도메인의 iBGP 풀메시 구성이 완전한가
Final Answer: ### 1. Direct Answer:
The iBGP full-mesh configuration within AS 65000 is not complete unless every iBGP peer within the AS is directly connected to every other iBGP peer. This is a fundamental requirement of iBGP to ensure that all routes learned from external BGP (eBGP) peers are propagated throughout the AS.

### 2. Technical Implementation:
To implement a full-mesh iBGP configuration in AS 65000, follow these steps:

1. **Identify iBGP Peers**: Determine all routers that will participate in iBGP within AS 65000. For example, assume you have three routers: R1, R2, and R3.

2. **Configure iBGP on Each Router**:
   - On Router R1:
     ```bash
     router bgp 65000
       neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65000  # R2
       neighbor 192.168.1.3 remote-as 65000  # R3
     ```

   - On Router R2:
     ```bash
     router bgp 65000
       neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65000  # R1
       neighbor 192.168.1.3 remote-as 65000  # R3
     ```

   - On Router R3:
     ```bash
     router bgp 65000
       neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65000  # R1
       neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65000  # R2
     ```

3. **Verify iBGP Peering**: After configuration, verify that all peers are established by using the following command on each router:
   ```bash
   show ip bgp summary
   ```

4. **Check Route Propagation**: Ensure that routes learned from eBGP peers are being propagated correctly through the iBGP mesh. Use:
   ```bash
   show ip bgp
   ```

### 3. Considerations:
- **Scalability**: Full-mesh iBGP can become impractical as the number of routers increases, leading to a significant increase in the number of peerings (N*(N-1)/2). Consider using route reflectors or confederations for larger AS designs.

- **Route Reflectors**: If scalability is a concern, implement route reflectors to reduce the number of required peerings. Designate one or more routers as route reflectors and configure clients accordingly.

- **Loop Prevention**: Ensure that the `next-hop` attribute is correctly managed, especially when using route reflectors, to prevent routing loops.

- **Session Stability**: Monitor the stability of iBGP sessions, as any flapping can lead to route instability. Use commands like `show ip bgp neighbors` to check the state of BGP sessions.

- **Security**: Implement BGP security best practices, such as using MD5 authentication for BGP sessions to prevent unauthorized access.

By following these steps and considerations, you can ensure a robust and complete iBGP full-mesh configuration within AS 65000.

Question: AS 65001 도메인의 iBGP 풀메시 구성이 완전한가
Final Answer: ### 1. Direct Answer:
The iBGP full-mesh configuration for AS 65001 is not complete unless every BGP router within the AS is directly peered with every other BGP router in the AS. This ensures that all routers can exchange routing information without relying on an external route reflector or confederation.

### 2. Technical Implementation:
To implement a full-mesh iBGP configuration in AS 65001, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Identify BGP Routers
Assume we have three routers in AS 65001: Router A (192.168.1.1), Router B (192.168.1.2), and Router C (192.168.1.3).

#### Step 2: Configure BGP on Each Router
You will need to configure BGP on each router to establish peering sessions with every other router.

**Router A Configuration:**
```bash
router bgp 65001
  neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65001
  neighbor 192.168.1.3 remote-as 65001
```

**Router B Configuration:**
```bash
router bgp 65001
  neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65001
  neighbor 192.168.1.3 remote-as 65001
```

**Router C Configuration:**
```bash
router bgp 65001
  neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65001
  neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65001
```

#### Step 3: Verify BGP Peering
After configuring the BGP sessions, verify that all peers are established correctly using the following command on each router:
```bash
show ip bgp summary
```
This command will show the status of BGP peers and the number of prefixes received.

### 3. Considerations:
- **Scalability:** A full-mesh configuration can become unmanageable as the number of routers increases. The number of required peerings grows quadratically (N*(N-1)/2). For larger networks, consider using route reflectors or BGP confederations to reduce the number of peerings.
  
- **Session Stability:** Ensure that all routers have stable network connectivity to maintain BGP sessions. Use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to verify connectivity between routers.

- **Loop Prevention:** iBGP does not prevent routing loops on its own. Ensure that proper route filtering and policies are in place to avoid loops.

- **Route Propagation:** Remember that iBGP does not propagate routes learned from one iBGP peer to another. All routers must be fully meshed to ensure that all routes are visible to all routers.

- **Keepalive Timers:** Adjust BGP keepalive timers if necessary to optimize session stability, especially in high-latency environments.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your iBGP full-mesh configuration in AS 65001 is complete and operational.

======================================================================
Question: AS 65003 도메인의 iBGP 풀메시 구성이 완전한가
Final Answer: ### 1. Direct Answer:
The iBGP full-mesh configuration for AS 65003 is not complete if all routers within the AS are not directly peering with each other. In a full-mesh iBGP setup, every router must establish a direct BGP session with every other router in the AS to ensure that BGP routes are fully propagated.

### 2. Technical Implementation:
To implement a full-mesh iBGP configuration in AS 65003, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Identify Routers
Assume we have three routers in AS 65003: R1, R2, and R3.

#### Step 2: Configure BGP on Each Router
On each router, you need to configure BGP and establish peerings with every other router.

**Router R1 Configuration:**
```bash
router bgp 65003
  neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65003  # Peer with R2
  neighbor 192.168.1.3 remote-as 65003  # Peer with R3
```

**Router R2 Configuration:**
```bash
router bgp 65003
  neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65003  # Peer with R1
  neighbor 192.168.1.3 remote-as 65003  # Peer with R3
```

**Router R3 Configuration:**
```bash
router bgp 65003
  neighbor 192.168.1.1 remote-as 65003  # Peer with R1
  neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65003  # Peer with R2
```

#### Step 3: Verify BGP Sessions
After configuring the peers, verify that all BGP sessions are established successfully on each router.

```bash
show ip bgp summary
```

This command should show that all routers have established BGP sessions with each other.

### 3. Considerations:
- **Scalability:** A full-mesh configuration can become unmanageable as the number of routers increases. For larger networks, consider using Route Reflectors or Confederations to reduce the number of peerings required.

- **Loop Prevention:** Ensure that the BGP configuration includes loop prevention mechanisms, such as the use of the `next-hop-self` command if necessary, especially when using Route Reflectors.

- **Keepalive Timers:** Adjust the BGP keepalive timers if necessary to suit your network's stability and performance requirements.

- **Route Filtering:** Implement route filtering (using prefix lists or route maps) to control which routes are advertised and accepted between peers, enhancing security and reducing unnecessary routing updates.

- **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the BGP sessions and the routing table to ensure that all routes are being propagated correctly and that there are no session drops or misconfigurations.

By following these steps and considerations, you can ensure that the iBGP full-mesh configuration in AS 65003 is complete and functioning as intended.

Question: AS 65000 iBGP 풀메시에서 누락된 링크 개수는?
Final Answer: [ANSWER]  
The number of missing links in an iBGP full mesh for AS 65000 can be calculated based on the number of routers participating in the iBGP.

[TECHNICAL DETAILS]  
1. **Determine the Number of Routers (n)**:  
   - Count the routers in AS 65000 that are configured for iBGP. For example, if there are 5 routers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5), then \( n = 5 \).

2. **Calculate Expected Full Mesh Links**:  
   - Use the formula for a full mesh:
     \[
     \text{Total Links} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
     \]
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     \[
     \text{Total Links} = \frac{5(5-1)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 10
     \]

3. **Identify Actual Links**:  
   - Execute the command to check current iBGP peerings:
     ```
     show ip bgp summary
     ```
   - Count the number of established peerings. For instance, if there are 7 established peerings, then you have 7 actual links.

4. **Calculate Missing Links**:  
   - Subtract the actual links from the expected links:
     \[
     \text{Missing Links} = \text{Total Links} - \text{Actual Links}
     \]
   - Continuing the example:
     \[
     \text{Missing Links} = 10 - 7 = 3
     \]

5. **Considerations**:  
   - **Scalability**: For larger networks, consider using route reflectors or confederations to minimize the number of required peerings.
   - **Redundancy**: Ensure redundancy in your iBGP setup to maintain communication if a router fails.
   - **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Regularly monitor iBGP peerings and link statuses. Utilize network management tools for automation.
   - **Security**: Implement MD5 authentication on iBGP sessions to secure routing information exchanges.
   - **Documentation**: Maintain an updated network diagram and documentation of your iBGP topology for troubleshooting and future expansions. 
======================================================================

======================================================================
Question: AS 65001 iBGP 풀메시에서 누락된 링크 개수는?
Final Answer: [ANSWER]  
The number of missing links in an iBGP full mesh for AS 65001 can be calculated based on the number of routers. If there are \( n \) routers, the missing links are given by \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} - \text{existing links} \).

[TECHNICAL DETAILS]  
To determine the number of missing links in an iBGP full mesh configuration for AS 65001, follow these steps:

1. **Count the Routers**: Identify the total number of routers (n) participating in iBGP within AS 65001. For example, if there are 5 routers:
   - \( n = 5 \)

2. **Calculate Required Links**: Use the formula for a complete graph to calculate the total number of links required for a full mesh:
   - Required Links = \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} = \frac{5(5-1)}{2} = 10 \)

3. **Identify Existing Links**: Check the current iBGP peerings configured on each router. You can use the following command on Cisco devices:
   ```bash
   show ip bgp summary
   ```
   This command will display the number of established iBGP sessions.

4. **Calculate Missing Links**: Subtract the number of existing links from the required links:
   - If, for example, there are currently 7 established iBGP sessions:
   - Missing Links = Required Links - Existing Links = 10 - 7 = 3

### Considerations:
- **Scalability**: As the number of routers increases, the number of required links grows quadratically. For larger networks, consider using route reflectors or confederations to reduce the number of iBGP sessions needed.

- **Redundancy**: Ensure that the iBGP sessions are configured for redundancy. This can include using loopback interfaces for peerings to maintain stability in case of physical link failures.

- **Route Reflectors**: If the network grows beyond a manageable size, implement route reflectors to simplify the iBGP topology. This reduces the number of required peerings significantly.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Regularly monitor iBGP sessions to ensure they are up and functioning. Use SNMP or network monitoring tools to alert on session failures.

- **Security Best Practices**: Implement MD5 authentication on iBGP sessions to secure against unauthorized access. Example configuration on Cisco:
   ```bash
   router bgp 65001
     neighbor <peer-ip> password <your-password>
   ```

By following these steps and considerations, you can effectively manage and maintain an iBGP full mesh configuration in AS 65001.
======================================================================

======================================================================
Question: AS 65003 iBGP 풀메시에서 누락된 링크 개수는?
Final Answer: ### 1. Direct Answer:
In an iBGP full mesh configuration, the number of missing links (or peering sessions) for AS 65003 can be calculated using the formula \( \frac{N(N-1)}{2} \), where \( N \) is the number of routers in the AS. If there are \( N \) routers and not all possible iBGP sessions are established, the number of missing links can be determined by subtracting the number of existing sessions from the total possible sessions.

### 2. Technical Implementation:
To determine the number of missing links in AS 65003, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Number of Routers**: Count the number of routers (N) in AS 65003. For example, if there are 5 routers, then \( N = 5 \).

2. **Calculate Total Possible iBGP Sessions**:
   \[
   \text{Total Sessions} = \frac{N(N-1)}{2} = \frac{5(5-1)}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Check Existing iBGP Sessions**: Use the following command on a router in AS 65003 to check the existing iBGP peers:
   ```
   show ip bgp summary
   ```
   This command will list the number of established iBGP sessions.

4. **Calculate Missing Links**:
   - If, for example, the output shows that there are 7 established sessions, then:
   \[
   \text{Missing Links} = \text{Total Sessions} - \text{Established Sessions} = 10 - 7 = 3
   \]

5. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure that all routers are configured to establish iBGP sessions with each other. The configuration might look like this on each router:
   ```plaintext
   router bgp 65003
     neighbor <peer-ip> remote-as 65003
   ```

### 3. Considerations:
- **Scalability**: As the number of routers increases, the number of required iBGP sessions grows quadratically, which can lead to scalability issues. Consider using route reflectors or confederations to reduce the number of required iBGP sessions.
  
- **Router Resources**: Ensure that each router has sufficient CPU and memory resources to handle the number of iBGP sessions. High numbers of sessions can lead to performance degradation.

- **Session Stability**: Monitor the stability of iBGP sessions. Frequent flaps can indicate network issues or misconfigurations.

- **Security Best Practices**: Implement authentication for iBGP sessions using MD5 passwords to prevent unauthorized peers from establishing sessions. Example configuration:
   ```plaintext
   neighbor <peer-ip> password <your-password>
   ```

By following these steps and considerations, you can effectively determine and manage the iBGP full mesh configuration in AS 65003.

Final Answer: Router A, Router B, Router C, Router D
======================================================================

======================================================================
Question: VRF exam-l3vpn 의 장비별 RD 매핑은?
Final Answer: ### 1. Direct Answer:
The Route Distinguisher (RD) mapping for VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) instances in an L3VPN (Layer 3 Virtual Private Network) can vary by device and vendor. However, the general practice is to assign unique RDs to each VRF instance to ensure that routes from different VRFs can coexist without conflict. 

### 2. Technical Implementation:
Here’s how to configure RD mapping for VRF instances on Cisco IOS and Juniper Junos devices:

#### Cisco IOS Configuration:
1. **Define the VRF:**
   ```bash
   ip vrf <VRF_NAME>
   rd <RD_VALUE>
   route-target export <RT_VALUE>
   route-target import <RT_VALUE>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   ip vrf Customer_A
   rd 65000:1
   route-target export 65000:1
   route-target import 65000:1
   ```

2. **Assign Interfaces to VRF:**
   ```bash
   interface <INTERFACE_TYPE> <INTERFACE_NUMBER>
   ip vrf forwarding <VRF_NAME>
   ip address <IP_ADDRESS> <SUBNET_MASK>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/0
   ip vrf forwarding Customer_A
   ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
   ```

#### Juniper Junos Configuration:
1. **Define the VRF:**
   ```bash
   set routing-instances <VRF_NAME> instance-type vrf
   set routing-instances <VRF_NAME> route-distinguisher <RD_VALUE>
   set routing-instances <VRF_NAME> vrf-target target:<RT_VALUE>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   set routing-instances Customer_A instance-type vrf
   set routing-instances Customer_A route-distinguisher 65000:1
   set routing-instances Customer_A vrf-target target:65000:1
   ```

2. **Assign Interfaces to VRF:**
   ```bash
   set interfaces <INTERFACE_NAME> unit 0 family inet address <IP_ADDRESS>/<PREFIX_LENGTH>
   set interfaces <INTERFACE_NAME> unit 0 family inet vrf <VRF_NAME>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1/24
   set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet vrf Customer_A
   ```

### 3. Considerations:
- **Uniqueness of RD:** Ensure that RDs are unique across the network to prevent route conflicts. The RD format is typically in the format of `<ASN>:<number>`, where ASN is the Autonomous System Number.
  
- **Route Targets (RT):** Use route targets to control the import and export of routes between different VRFs. It is a best practice to use the same RT for both import and export for a particular VRF to maintain route visibility.

- **Documentation:** Maintain proper documentation of RD and RT assignments to avoid confusion and facilitate troubleshooting.

- **Testing:** After configuration, verify the VRF setup using commands like `show ip vrf` on Cisco or `show route table <VRF_NAME>` on Juniper to ensure that the VRF is functioning as expected.

- **Security:** Consider implementing access control lists (ACLs) or firewall filters to secure traffic between different VRFs, especially in multi-tenant environments.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage RD mapping for VRF instances across different network devices.

Question: 구성된 L2VPN pseudowire 회선(장비쌍) 목록은?
Final Answer: P2P_sample9_sample7, P2P_sample7_sample9
======================================================================

======================================================================
Question: PW-ID 불일치 L2VPN 회선(장비쌍) 목록은?
Final Answer: [ANSWER]  
To identify the list of L2VPN circuits (device pairs) with mismatched PW-IDs, use the command-line interface of your network devices to check the status of pseudowires and compare their identifiers.

[TECHNICAL DETAILS]  
1. **Access the Device:**
   - Log into the router or switch using SSH or console access.

2. **Enter Privileged EXEC Mode:**
   ```bash
   enable
   ```

3. **Show L2VPN Pseudowires:**
   - Execute the following command to display the status of all pseudowires:
   ```bash
   show l2vpn pseudowire
   ```

4. **Analyze Output:**
   - Review the output for entries where the PW-ID does not match between local and remote endpoints. Focus on the `PW ID`, `Local Interface`, `Remote Interface`, and `Status` columns.

5. **Filter for Mismatches:**
   - If supported, use filtering or scripting to automate the identification of mismatched PW-IDs. Redirect the output to a file and parse it with a script.

6. **Example Output Analysis:**
   - The output may look like this:
   ```
   PW ID   Local Interface   Remote Interface   Status
   1001    Gig0/0           Gig0/1            Up
   1002    Gig0/2           Gig0/3            Down
   1003    Gig0/4           Gig0/5            Up
   ```
   - Identify mismatches by comparing expected connections.

### Considerations:
- **Consistency Across Devices:** Ensure configurations on both ends of the L2VPN are consistent to avoid connectivity issues.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement monitoring tools to alert you to mismatches in real-time.
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed documentation of L2VPN configurations, including expected PW-IDs for each circuit.
- **Vendor-Specific Commands:** For other vendors, such as Juniper, use:
   ```bash
   show l2vpn connections
   ```
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of L2VPN configurations to ensure accuracy and prevent discrepancies in PW-IDs.

By following these steps, you can effectively identify and resolve PW-ID mismatches in your L2VPN configurations.
======================================================================

======================================================================
Question: PW-ID 불일치(또는 역방향 미존재) 회선 수는?
Final Answer: [ANSWER]  
The number of circuits with PW-ID mismatches or missing reverse paths can be determined by checking the pseudowire configurations and statuses on both endpoints.

[TECHNICAL DETAILS]  
To identify and resolve PW-ID mismatches or missing reverse paths, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Check Pseudowire Status  
Use the command below on both endpoints to check the status of the pseudowires:

```bash
show mpls l2vpn pw
```
This command will provide information on the status of all pseudowires, including their PW-IDs and any error messages.

#### Step 2: Verify Configuration  
Ensure that the configurations on both ends of the pseudowire match. Check the following:

- **Pseudowire ID**: Confirm that the PW-ID is identical on both devices.
- **Encapsulation Type**: Verify that both ends are using the same encapsulation method (e.g., Ethernet, ATM).
- **VC Type**: Ensure that the VC type is consistent (e.g., VPLS, VPWS).

Example configuration for a pseudowire:

```bash
interface xconnect <remote-ip> <pw-id> encapsulation mpls
```

#### Step 3: Check for Reverse Path  
If the reverse path is missing, verify the configuration of the reverse pseudowire. For instance, if the primary pseudowire is configured as follows:

```bash
interface xconnect <remote-ip> <pw-id> encapsulation mpls
```
You should also have a corresponding configuration on the remote side:

```bash
interface xconnect <local-ip> <pw-id> encapsulation mpls
```

#### Step 4: Validate Connectivity  
To validate connectivity between the endpoints, use:

```bash
ping <remote-ip>
```
If the ping fails, check the routing configurations to ensure a valid path exists between the two endpoints.

### Security Considerations  
- Ensure that access to the network devices is secured to prevent unauthorized changes to configurations.
- Regularly update device firmware to mitigate vulnerabilities that could affect pseudowire operations.

### Best Practices  
- Maintain consistency in configurations across both ends of the pseudowire to avoid mismatches.
- Implement monitoring tools to regularly check the status of pseudowires for early detection of issues.
- Keep detailed documentation of all pseudowire configurations, including PW-IDs and encapsulation types, to facilitate troubleshooting.
- Follow MPLS best practices, such as using descriptive names for interfaces and ensuring all necessary protocols (e.g., LDP, BGP) are operational.

Question: 역방향이 없는 L2VPN 회선(장비쌍) 개수는?
Final Answer: ### 1. Direct Answer:
역방향이 없는 L2VPN 회선(장비쌍) 개수는 네트워크의 구성과 요구 사항에 따라 다르지만, 일반적으로 L2VPN은 두 장비 간의 단일 회선으로 구성됩니다. 따라서, 각 장비 쌍에 대해 하나의 L2VPN 회선이 필요합니다. 예를 들어, 두 개의 장비 간에 L2VPN을 설정하면 총 1개의 L2VPN 회선이 생성됩니다.

### 2. Technical Implementation:
L2VPN을 설정하는 방법은 여러 가지가 있지만, 여기서는 MPLS 기반의 VPLS(Virtual Private LAN Service)를 예로 들어 설명하겠습니다. Cisco 장비를 기준으로 한 기본적인 설정 절차는 다음과 같습니다.

1. **MPLS 및 VPLS 활성화**:
   ```bash
   conf t
   mpls ip
   mpls ldp router-id Loopback0 force
   ```

2. **VPLS 인스턴스 생성**:
   ```bash
   l2vpn
   vfi VPLS-1 manual
   vpn id 100
   bridge
   ```

3. **L2VPN에 포트 추가**:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   no shutdown
   l2vpn vfi VPLS-1
   ```

4. **MPLS 라우팅 설정**:
   ```bash
   interface Tunnel0
   ip unnumbered Loopback0
   mpls ip
   ```

5. **VPLS 피어링 설정**:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/2
   no shutdown
   l2vpn vfi VPLS-1
   ```

6. **VPLS 피어 IP 주소 설정**:
   ```bash
   l2vpn
   vfi VPLS-1 manual
   vpn id 100
   neighbor 192.0.2.1
   ```

### 3. Considerations:
- **MTU 설정**: L2VPN을 사용할 때는 MTU(Maximum Transmission Unit) 설정을 주의해야 합니다. MPLS 헤더가 추가되므로, MTU를 적절히 조정해야 패킷 손실을 방지할 수 있습니다.
  
- **QoS 설정**: L2VPN 트래픽에 대해 QoS(Quality of Service) 정책을 설정하여 대역폭을 관리하고 지연을 최소화하는 것이 중요합니다.

- **보안**: L2VPN은 네트워크의 Layer 2에서 작동하므로, 보안이 취약할 수 있습니다. VLAN을 사용하여 트래픽을 분리하고, MAC 주소 필터링 및 ACL(Access Control Lists)을 통해 보안을 강화해야 합니다.

- **모니터링 및 트러블슈팅**: L2VPN의 상태를 모니터링하고 문제를 해결하기 위해 `show l2vpn` 및 `show mpls ldp neighbor` 명령어를 사용하여 연결 상태와 LDP(Labeled Distribution Protocol) 이웃을 확인하는 것이 좋습니다.

이러한 설정과 고려 사항을 통해 안정적이고 효율적인 L2VPN 회선을 구축할 수 있습니다.

- **Security Best Practices**: Always utilize SSH version 2, as it offers superior encryption and security features. If SSH version 1 is detected, it should be disabled to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Configuration**: Ensure that your device's SSH configuration is secure. For Cisco devices, enforce SSH version 2 by entering the following command in global configuration mode:
   ```bash
   ip ssh version 2
   ```
- **Key Length**: When generating RSA keys for SSH, use a key length of at least 2048 bits, with 4096 bits recommended for enhanced security:
   ```bash
   crypto key generate rsa modulus 4096
   ```
- **Access Control**: Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict SSH access to trusted IP addresses only. For example:
   ```bash
   access-list 23 permit 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255
   line vty 0 4
   transport input ssh
   access-class 23 in
   ```
- **Regular Updates**: Keep your SSH client and server software updated to safeguard against known vulnerabilities and exploits.
- **Logging**: Consider enabling logging for SSH login events to monitor access attempts:
   ```bash
   ip ssh logging events
   ```

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your network devices are operating with a secure and compatible version of SSH.
